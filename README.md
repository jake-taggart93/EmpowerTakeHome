**Please see notes:**

Because of prior engagements I needed to keep between the time I was given the challenge and the 24 hour mark, I was unable to complete the 2nd portion of the challenge. You will notice for that portion, the fragment does not show when an item is clicked. The majority of the ground work is done for that portion, but I couldn't find time over the past 24 hours to come back to fix that portion.

**Quick notes:**
- No 3rd party libraries
- MVVM used
- LiveData used
- Flow used

**Things I struggled with:**
- I struggled with using CustomViews with as little XML as possible (as I was directed to do). Recently I have grown much more accustomed to working with Compose or at the very least XML layouts. It had been so long since I had worked predominantly with CustomViews programmatically that it didn't feel natural.
- I found not being able to use any 3rd party library made me think a bit more as I am used to using 3rd party libraries for Dependency Injection, JSON parsing, and so on.
- I unfortuantely could not find as much time as I would have liked to work on this. I had some engagements planned which I had to keep and as a result only had ~2 hours to spend on the project.

**Improvements for a hypothetical continuation:**
- Finish the issue with part 2
- Style the custom views more
- Write a few tests
